This is the official website for “Circuitrix”, the final project of EE202A Embedded Systems at UCLA. The goal of this project is to design a system which can generate a netlist file from hand-drawn circuits using image processing techniques and then simulate the generated netlist file in SPICE to find the voltage across and current through each resistor.

The Mission

Detect a hand-drawn circuit diagram
Recognize individual elements of the circuit
Construct a SPICE netlist file
Send the netlist file to a PC
Simulate netlist file in SPICE
